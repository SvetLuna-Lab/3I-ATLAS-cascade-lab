# 3I-ATLAS Cascade Lab — Overview

This repository is a personal **cascade modelling and observation lab**
for the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS.

It has three layers:

1. **Event tracking (logbook)**  
   Keeping a structured record of NASA live events, press releases,
   papers and data products related to 3I/ATLAS.

2. **Observations**  
   Collecting both:
   - official data (once public data products are released);
   - my own sky observations with time, location and visual descriptions.

3. **Cascade-based models and analysis**  
   Using physics-inspired and AI-supported methods to:
   - explore temporal patterns in the data (bursts, plateaus, transitions);
   - build cascade diagrams that connect physical processes,
     observational signatures and levels of the system;
   - document everything in open notebooks and diagrams.

The lab is intentionally small and transparent.  
It is not meant to compete with professional pipelines, but to provide:

- a clear, reproducible citizen-science workspace;
- a place where ideas from **cascade mathematics, AI and consciousness studies**
  can touch a real interstellar object in a disciplined way.
