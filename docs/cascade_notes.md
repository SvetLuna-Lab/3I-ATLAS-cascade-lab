# Cascade Notes for 3I/ATLAS

Here I will collect early ideas about how to see 3I/ATLAS
through the lens of cascade models.

Possible layers and transitions (to refine later):

- solar system environment ↔ interstellar trajectory;
- interaction with solar radiation and wind;
- changes in activity and brightness over time;
- observational layers: instruments, filters, campaigns.

These notes are intentionally rough.  
Once patterns stabilise, they will be turned into cleaner diagrams
and linked from the notebooks.
