# 3I/ATLAS Logbook

Chronological log of events, data releases and relevant references for
the interstellar comet **3I/ATLAS**.

This log is meant to be:

- a compact reference for future analysis,
- a transparent record of what I followed and when.

### 2025-11-19 – NASA live event (“NASA Shares Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS Images”)

- **Source:** [YouTube livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A55SUq2eDXg)  
- **Note:** my question about open access to observational data was taken live.
  The team encouraged contributions from independent researchers and
  citizen scientists, and suggested sending observations/results
  through the official channels.
- **Action items:**
  - rewatch the segment around 41:45 and extract concrete information
    about data products and recommended submission channels;
  - prepare this repository structure (logbook, observation formats, notebooks).
